Mashable is an Internet news blog set up by Pete Cashmore on July, 2005. It is one of the most popular blogs and the largest news websites, with more than 7 million web traffic per month. And Mashable has turned into  a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company. Data shows that the large proportion of profit of this private company comes from displaying advertisement. Popularity can  help to attract more visitors and thus increase exposure/clicks for advertisements. Therefore, we analyze and suggest key factors that help Mashable improve its websites’ popularity.


In order to get a better understand of what features greatly affect the popularity of Mashable news websites, we use R to implement some data analysis  from a statistical perspective based on collected data from UCI Machine Learning repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+News+Popularity).


The dataset’s acquisition date was January 8th, 2015 and all the collected data ranged from January 7th, 2013 to December 27th, 2014 (723 days). This dataset includes 3,9644 news articles (instances). In the original dataset, there is 1 goal field (Y)—the total number of shares for each news article, 59 attributes (X) used to predict this goal and a non-predicted attribute—url, through which we can retrieve the data source.
